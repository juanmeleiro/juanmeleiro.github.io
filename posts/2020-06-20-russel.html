<h1 id="a-warning-tale">A Warning Tale</h1>
<p>Bernard the Bearded had a self-imposed rule<br />
He thought shaving his own beard would make him a fool</p>
<p>But at this time of the month his facial hear was too long<br />
It got to the point that it just felt wrong</p>
<p>Alas! Away from home he was<br />
Passing through a strange town known for having its own laws</p>
<p>He walked along the streets looking for a barber<br />
Square after square from the park to the harbor</p>
<p>Finally, at last, when he walked downtown<br />
He found what seemed to be the only barber around</p>
<p>So he walked through the door whithout even ringing the bell<br />
And exclaimed “I need a shave, but I can’t do it myself!”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re in luck”, hastly answered the barber<br />
“We’ve done it many times – your case shouldn’t be harder”</p>
<p>As Bernard laid down on the barbershop chair<br />
The town’s clock announced midday, from the neaby square</p>
<p>While preparing his razor, the man further explained<br />
“My shop is truly special”, he proudly ascertained</p>
<p>The barber continued over the sound of the bells<br />
“I shave exactly those that do not shave themselves”</p>
<p>“What a strange choice”, thought Bernard, as anyone would find<br />
Until something stranger struck his mind</p>
<p>“Wait a minute”, Bernard interjected, as the barber took the cream from the shelf<br />
“What about you?”, he asked, “do you shave yourself?”</p>
<p>Silence ensued<br />
That particular subject always spoiled the mood</p>
<p>“We do not talk about that”, sternly warned the barber<br />
“Let us not take this subject any further”</p>
<p>But Bearnard the bearded was puzzled still<br />
And continued his thought, having no social skill</p>
<p>“If you do not shave yourself”, hypothesized him without further ado<br />
And conclued: “Then you must surely do”</p>
<p>“But in that case”, thr counterargument he put forth<br />
“We must conclude, that you do certainly not!”</p>
<p>The barber was paralysed<br />
The only thing left was the fear in his eyes</p>
<p>Thunder stroke<br />
Announcing the coming of what Bernard had awoke</p>
<p>“My name if Paradox”, said the barber as he trew the man against the wall<br />
“And you, sir, have doomed us all”</p>
<p>And at that, the world turned into mist<br />
As everything they knew ceased to exist</p>
<p>And that, dear child, is the lesson eerie<br />
Why you should not, whatsoever, play with set theory</p>
